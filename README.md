# How to submit this lab (and show your work)

Moving forward, we'll submit lab notebooks as `.py` files. 

One option is to have a `.py` file that you use to run code and test programs while working through the lab. When ready to submit the lab notebook, you add comments and remove extraneous materials.

Another option is to have an "official" `.py` file that you are using as a lab notebook (separate from your working/testing file). Use comments in Python to note when you are starting a new question (as well as answering a question).
  * Example: `Lab5_Notebook_Walden.py`

What gets submitted as the lab notebook is the `Lab5_Notebook_Walden.py` file.
- When in doubt, use comments
- Be sure you are using comments to note what question you're responding to
